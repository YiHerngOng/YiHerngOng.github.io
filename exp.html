	<h2>IROS 2019, Nov 4 ~ Nov 8 2019</h2>
	<p>I attended the International Conference of Robots and Systems, which was held in Macau, China, to present my research work in robotic manipulation. I really had a great time meeting people from industry and academia, we talked about potential research ideas, contemporary challenges in robotics and aritificial intelligence. Also, I got to explore Macau, an amazing city that I had never been to before.</p>
