	<h2>Improve robot grasping ability under uncertainties with deep reinforcement learning</h2>
	<h3>Master Thesis</h3>
	<p>From my previous work, human studies showed that humans performed much better than robots at moving robot fingers while grasping objects under uncertainties. I took one of the found grasping strategies that we learned from human subjects as expert demonstration, and teach robot not only be able to grasp an object at any random in-hand positions, but also capable to grasp a wide variety of objects with different shapes and sizes.</p>
	<p>This work is submitted to conference Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS), 2020</p>

	<h2>Humans and Robot studies on near contact grasping</h2>
	<p>I designed, and conducted a humans studies on multiple robot hands to observe the grasping strategies that adapted by humans under uncertainties and constrained environments. I concluded an overall 3 primitive control strategies from humans and turned them into fine-tuned PID grasping controllers. This work published to International Conference on Robots and Systems (IROS), 2019.</p>

	<h2>Evaluate grasp by exploiting geometric information</h2>
	<p>I collaborated with a student working on generating new grasp metrics that exploit geometric relationships between robot finger pads and object surfaces. This work is published to International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2019.</p>

	<h2>Analyze capabilities of robot hands from human studies</h2>
	<p>I assisted a PhD student to run experiments, analyze data to evaluate capabilites of robot hands with different DOFs, joint designs and actuation schemes. This work is publised to International Conference on Robots and Systems, 2018.</p>

	<h2>4-DOF Yale OpenHand Model O</h2>
	<p>I built a 4-DOF robot hand that is designed by robotics group at Yale University.</p>

	<h2>Robot Finger Pad Design</h2>
	<p>It was a senior captone design project in my senior year. I collaborated with a Mechanical Engineering student to design a soft-material pad for robot fingers by using 3D printing. Our design aimed to improve grasping ability (mechanically) of a Barrett Hand.</p>
